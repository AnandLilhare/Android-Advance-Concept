Android TDD Masterckass


3 Rules of TDD

1. You may not write production code until you have written a failing unit test
2. You may not write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling is failing.
3. You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing test.

Type of Automated Test

1. Unit: Test a very small block of code, usually a method.
2. Integration: Software modules are combined and tested as a group.
3. End to End : Testing an application workflow form begining to end.
